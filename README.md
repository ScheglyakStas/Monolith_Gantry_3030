# Monolith_Gantry_3030
A remix of CloakedWayne's Monolith Gantry using 3030 extrusions and MGN12H Y-axis rails, allowing it to be installed on 3030 frame printers.

Changes compared to original:
- Uses 3030 extrusions for better rigidity
- Uses MGN12H rails on Y axis (due to MGN9 being incompatible with 3030)

As for now, the only version available is 9/10mm 2WD with decoupled motors.

BOM and a non-decoupled version will be added soon.
