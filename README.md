#Monolith Gantry 3030
A remix of CloakedWayne's sheet metal Monolith Gantry using 3030 extrusions and MGN12H Y-axis rails, that allow it to be installed on 3030 frame 3D printers.

Changes compared to the original:
- 3030 extrusions and M8 screws for better rigidity
- MGN12H rails on Y axis (due to MGN9 being incompatible with 3030)

As for now, the only version available is 9/10mm 2WD with decoupled motors.

BOM and a non-decoupled version will be added soon.
